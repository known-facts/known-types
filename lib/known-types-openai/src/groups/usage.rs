//! OpenAI API: Usage

//! The **Usage API** provides detailed insights into your activity across the
//! OpenAI API. It also includes a separate [Costs
//! endpoint](/docs/api-reference/usage/costs), which offers visibility into
//! your spend, breaking down consumption by invoice line items and project IDs.
//! While the Usage API delivers granular usage data, it may not always
//! reconcile perfectly with the Costs due to minor differences in how usage and
//! spend are recorded. For financial purposes, we recommend using the [Costs
//! endpoint](/docs/api-reference/usage/costs) or the [Costs
//! tab](/settings/organization/usage) in the Usage Dashboard, which will
//! reconcile back to your billing invoice.
